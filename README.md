# trading_bot_portfolio

This repository is a **portfolio version** of my current private personal project.  
It includes only selected parts of the original codebase, with sensitive or unpublished components intentionally removed.  
The purpose of this repo is **not to run** the full trading bot, but rather to showcase key aspects of the project in a professional context.

The portfolio version includes **approximately 14,179 lines of code**, compared to over **29,000 lines** in the complete project.

## 🔒 What has been removed?

To preserve the originality and confidentiality of my work, I excluded:

- The **core training logic** for the models (as the training pipeline uses a custom approach I have not seen published elsewhere)
- My **new architectures** (only legacy model versions are included)
- Most of the **feature engineering pipeline** (only basic/common features are shown)
- The **main data scraping engine** (only tooling and helper scripts are included)

## 📝 Notes

- This repository will **not be maintained** or updated in the future, as it is not meant for public use or reproduction.
- The `senti3_AI` folder is in **early-stage development** and is currently incomplete.
