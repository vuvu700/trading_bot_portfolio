# trading_bot_portfolio
this repo is a portfolio version of my current personal project that is private
all the code in this project is only a selection of code that i can show without giving my work
it isn't intended to run but to show the project as part of my profolio
there is only 14'179 lines of code in the protfolio compared to the 29k of the full project

## what did I removed ?
 - the core of the training of the models (since i never seen any paper doing the same)
 - the new architectures that i am using (kept the legacy architectures)
 - most of the features engenering that i have done (kept the most common)
 - core of the data scraping (kept the scraper tools)

## notes: 
 - this repository will not be updated since it isn't a public version but only a portfolio
 - the senti3 AI foler is in early developement so it isn't complet
